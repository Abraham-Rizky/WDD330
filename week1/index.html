      <h3>Notes</h3>
      <p>I have always thought that to create a better user experience I need to build my app from bigger screen to 
        smaller screen. From the video, I learned how important it is to build our apps from small screen
        and build it up for bigger screens such as tablets or desktop computers. I also learned about reachability
        for users and how it can create the illusion that the app is faster and create a smoother user experience.
        I learned about advertisement and pop ups which can be annoying sometimes for the users. It reminds me of 
        Amazon.com that created a smooth user experience with some great advertising content placements in their apps.

      <ol>
        <li>When is localstorage deleted? Is it similar to session storage?</li>
        <li>Is local storage also available on mobile browsers?</li>
