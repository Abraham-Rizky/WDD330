      <h3>Notes</h3><br>
      <ol>
        <li>We can access the form name by using square bracket notation or by using a period</li>
        <li>We can use button with type of reset to reset all the form controls back to their initial values without the need of additional scripting.</li>
        <li>I learned about class declaration syntax that was introduced by ES6 that does exactly the same thing as a constructor function, but looks much similar to writing a class in a class-based programming language</li>
        <li>Static methods are not available to instances of the class. So the instances of Dice such as redDice and blueDice cannot call the static description() method</li>
        <li>The prototype object is live, so if a new property or method is added to the prototype, any instances of its class will inherit the new properties and methods automatically, even if that instance has already been created</li>
        <li>Itâ€™s possible to borrow methods from objects without having to inherit all their properties and methods using call()</li>
        <li>I learned about require() which takes the file that contains the module as an argument and returns the function that was exported. This reminds me of partial variables in SASS. Example: const square = require('./squareFunction');</li>
        <li>preventDefault() can be used to prevent a form from being submitted</li>
        <li>Minifying your code can have a major effect on the overall size of your files, making them download and run faster but it is significantly smaller in size, but much more difficult to read and make sense of</li>

      <h3>Questions:</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>What is the real life use of the init() in JavaScript?</li>
        <li>I was wondering if the principles of mixins in JavaScript is almost similar with mixins in SASS.</li>
