      <h3>Notes</h3><br>
      <ol>
        <li>Square brackets can be used to access property object in JavaScript</li>
        <li>
          I learned about ‘in’ operator that can be used to check if properties or methods exist in an object. For example: <br>
          <span>‘city’ in superman;</span><br>
        </li>
        <li>
          I learned about stringify method that takes a JavaScript object and returning a string of JSON data
        </li>
        <li>
          I also learned about regular expression which is a pattern that can be used to search strings for matches to the pattern in JavaScript which I found really useful.
        </li>
        <li>
          I also learned about nodeType and nodeName which can access the type of node and name of node respectively using JavaScript in HTML documents        
        </li>
        <li>
          I learned about toggle method which adds a class if it doesn’t exist or remove the class if it does have it.
        </li>
        <li>
          I learned about touch events that are used on touch screen monitors, phones, and tablets. 
          They are almost the same event listeners such as onClick but for touch screen. There are some listeners such as touchstart, touchmove, and touchleave.
        </li>
        <li>
          I learned that each touch object has a touch.identifier property which is a unique ID that can be used to ensure we are dealing with the same touch.
        </li>
      </ol>
