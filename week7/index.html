    <h3>Notes</h3><br>
    <ol>
      <li>Memorization is a useful feature in JS that can save the result in a cache property.</li>
      <li>An Immediately Invoked Function Expression – or IIFE (pronounced “iffy”) – is
        an anonymous function that, as the name suggests, is invoked as soon as it’s
        defined.</li>
      <li>JS is still single-threaded, so only one task can run at one time.</li>
      <li>When a promise is created, it calls an asynchronous operation and is then said to
        be pending. It remains in this state while the operation is taking place.</li>
      <li>Whenever a function is defined inside another function, the inner
        function will have access to any variables that are declared in the outer function's
        scope.</li>
      <li>A closure is formed when the inner function is returned by the outer function,
        maintaining access to any variables declared inside the enclosing function.</li>
      <li>The difference between the yield and the return keywords is that by
        using yield, the state of the value returned is remembered the next time yield is
        called.</li>
      <li>The blob() method is used to read a file of raw data, such as an image or a
        spreadsheet. Once it has read the whole file, it returns a promise that resolves
        with a blob object.</li>
    </ol>
